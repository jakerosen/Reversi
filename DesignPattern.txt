Pattern: Strategy

Context: Define how to collect input from the turn player to make a move.

Motvation: Regardless of how the UI looks, whether it's a GUI or console
  interface, the decisions made in the game logic are the same. The strategy
  design pattern allows us to use the same core game logic regardless of which
  user interface we are using, and we pass in which strategy (UI) we would like
  to use.

Implementation: We implemented an interface, UIStrategy, which has a few methods
  for controlling output to the screen, including ways to initialize the board,
  start a new game, display the legal moves that a player can make, and
  update the UI with the new board. A concrete class, ConsoleInterface,
  implements UIStrategy for the console version of the game, and View implements
  UIStrategy for the GUI version of the program.
