Pattern: Strategy

Context: Define how to collect input from the turn player to make a move.

Motivation: Regardless of how the user input is collected, the action of making
  the move in the game logic is the same. The strategy design pattern allows us
  to use the same core game logic regardless of which user interface we are
  using, and we pass in which strategy (UI) we would like to use.

Implementation: We implemented an interface, InputStrategy, which has a single
  method that returns the selected position that the turn player would like to
  move to.  A concrete class, ConsoleInterface, implements InputStrategy and
  uses a Scanner to collect the user input from System.in.  When implemented,
  the graphical version of the game will have a concrete class that implements
  InputStrategy which will use a JButton with an ActionListener to get the
  user input.
