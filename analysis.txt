Two players (white and black)
8x8 board (64 spaces total)
Each space can be white, black or empty.

Take turns (black goes first):
  Place one piece in a legal location.
    Legal locations are any space where there is a direct straight of connected
    pieces to another piece of that player's color.
    Straight is defined as horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

  When a piece is placed, flip all pieces in between the placed piece and the
  piece that had a connected straight to that player's color.

  If a player cannot make a legal move, they pass.  If both players cannot make
  a legal move, the game ends.

When the game ends, determine the winner:
  Count the pieces of each player's color.  The player with the highest number
  of pieces wins.  If there is a tie, then the game is tied.
